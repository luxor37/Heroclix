# Heroclix
Recreating Heroclix on unity to make it easier for new player to play without having to remember all the rules

Wizkids decided to drop heroclix online and unfortunately my local comic book shops are dropping the game becasue it's less popular. I wat to be able to play with my friends without having them memorize too much rules.
I am therefore trying to redo Heroclix online for personal use so I can play with my friends and automate some rules. Once the base game is functionnal, I plan on scanning my Heroclix collection and add it to the game. Any 3D models of figs are welcome if you want to share some.
